Mount Berlin is a glacier-covered volcano in Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica. It is a roughly 20-kilometre-wide (12 mi) mountain with parasitic vents. It consists of two coalesced volcanoes: Berlin proper with the 2-kilometre-wide (1.2 mi) Berlin Crater, and Merrem Peak 3.5 kilometres (2.2 mi) away with a 2.5-by-1-kilometre-wide (1.6 mi Ã— 0.6 mi) crater. Mount Berlin has a volume of 200 cubic kilometres (50 cu mi) and rises 3,478 metres (11,411 ft) above sea level from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. It is part of the Marie Byrd Land Volcanic Province. Trachyte is the dominant volcanic rock, occurring as solidified lava flows and pyroclastic rocks. The volcano was active from the Pliocene into the Holocene. Tephra layers from all over Antarctica have been linked to Mount Berlin, the major regional source of such tephras. The tephra was formed by explosive eruptions that generated high eruption columns. Currently, fumarolic activity occurs that forms ice towers from frozen steam.
